Sample C++ Code:  Nonlinear Optimization Library
(includes 3rd-Party FORTRAN library)

---

 

This is a subset of a personal project.  I've been porting the code
from my doctoral-research from a mixture of C & FORTRAN to a mixture
of C++ & FORTRAN, using modern C++ programming techniques (prior to
the C++11 standard) and best-practices.  (The FORTRAN comes from a
standard scientific library; the C/C++ code is mine.)

This repository contains just the nonlinear least-squares fitting
library, its dependencies, and the library that uses it.  It also
contains source-code documentation (generated by Doxygen) and one of
the unit-tests.  (The rest are tedious, cryptic, or boring.)


A good starting point is the class`'FitLM_Adapter`.

To see an example of how it's used, look at the class
`FitLM_BarrierAdapter` and its dependencies.  Interestingly,
`FitLM_BarrierAdapter` uses policy-classes to create a family of
nonlinear-fitters for the same data.
