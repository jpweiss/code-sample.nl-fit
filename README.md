Sample C++ Code:  Nonlinear Optimization Library

---

 

This is a subset of a personal project.  I've been porting the code
from my doctoral-research from a mixture of C & FORTRAN to a mixture
of C++ & FORTRAN, using modern C++ programming techniques (prior to
the C++11 standard) and best-practices.  (The FORTRAN comes from a
standard scientific library; the C/C++ code is mine.)

To keep this file short, I've put more details in the `src/README.md`
file.  The subdirectories under `src` all have their own `README.md` files.
Do read them.

For those in a hurry:

* Start with the class `FitLM_Adapter`.
* The source-code documentation (generated by Doxygen) is available
  under `srcdoc/html/index.html`.

(Note: You will need to do a `git pull` in order to be able to read the
source-code documentation.  Otherwise, you'll just be looking at raw HTML.)

Motivation
-----------

TBA:  Description of the problem being solved with this code.

Notes:

* Want the calls to the FORTRAN code to be as C++-like as possible.
* Want the C++ wrapper to have no performance hit.  Inlining should
  reduce the entire C++-to-FORTRAN adapter down to the FORTRAN call.
