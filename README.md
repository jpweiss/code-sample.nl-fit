Sample C++ Code:  Nonlinear Optimization Library
(includes 3rd-Party FORTRAN library)

---

 

This is a subset of a personal project.  I've been porting the code
from my doctoral-research from a mixture of C & FORTRAN to a mixture
of C++ & FORTRAN, using modern C++ programming techniques (prior to
the C++11 standard) and best-practices.  (The FORTRAN comes from a
standard scientific library; the C/C++ code is mine.)

> Note:  The presence of the external FORTRAN library is why GitHub
> misidentifies the language of this repository as "FORTRAN".  The
> language of this repository is really C++.

To keep this file short, I've put more details in the `src/README.md`
file.  The subdirectories under `src` all have their own `README.md` files.
Do read them.

For those in a hurry:

* Start with the class `FitLM_Adapter`.
* The source-code documentation (generated by Doxygen) is available
  under `srcdoc/html/index.html`.
