Placeholder file.  More to come...

Outline:

1. What the BarrierModels.h functors are doing, in broad strokes.
2. Modern C++ Design through Template-Policy classes.
   What the business with this separate 'calculate<>' is.
3. Why there's both a *.cc and a *.tcc file.
4. How FitLM_BarrierAdapter pulls it all together.
