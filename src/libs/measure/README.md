Fitting a Nonlinear Model to Data:  `FitLM_Adapter` in Action
=============================================================

 

Placeholder file.  More to come...

Outline:

1. Start with a quick description of the "barrier-model" and a really
   quick reference to the PersistenceMap (with emphasis on what the
   phases_as_1D() and lags_as_1D() are returning (what those
   flattened-matrixes contain)).
1. What the BarrierModels.h functors are doing, in broad strokes.
2. Modern C++ Design through Template-Policy classes.
   What the business with this separate 'calculate<>' is.
3. Why there's both a *.cc and a *.tcc file.
4. How FitLM_BarrierAdapter pulls it all together.
